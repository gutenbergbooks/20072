  </div><a name="pg_9" id="pg_9"></a>

  <h4>THE COLORS</h4>

  <div class="c11">
    <p>It isn't just colors and bunting&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">The red and the blue and the white.</span><br>
    It's something heaps better and finer,&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">It's the <em>soul</em> of my country <em>in sight!</em></span></p>

    <p>There's a lot of ceremony 'bout the Flag,<br>
    <span class="c2">Though many half-baked patriots believe</span><br>
    Salutin' it and hangin' it correct<br>
    <span class="c2">"Is only loyalty upon the sleeve."</span><br>
    But we who work beneath the Flag to-day,<br>
    <span class="c2">Who'll honor it&mdash;and die for it, perhaps&mdash;</span><br>
    Get a slightly different view of the old red, white and blue<br>
    <span class="c2">Than is visioned by th' criticisin' chaps.</span></p>

    <p>It isn't just for decoratin' things,<br>
    <span class="c2">It isn't just an emblem, clean and bright,</span><br>
    No matter what its "hoist" or what its "fly,"<br>
    <span class="c2">To us it means our country&mdash;wrong or right!</span><br>
    The sobby stuff that some good people spout<br>
    <span class="c2">Won't help a man to understand this view,</span><br>
    But: Wherever that Flag goes, the man who follows, <em>knows</em><br>
    <span class="c2">That a better, cleaner citizen <em>goes too!</em></span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">It's not just a banner to look at,&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c3">For which we're expected to fight;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">It's something that represents <em>freedom;</em></span><br>
    <span class="c3">It's the <em>soul</em> of my country&mdash;in sight!</span></p><a name="pg_10" id="pg_10"></a>

    <h4>LOYALTY</h4>

    <p>This is no time to quibble or to fool;<br>
    <span class="c2">To argue over who was wrong, who right;</span><br>
    To measure fealty with a worn foot-rule;<br>
    <span class="c2">To ask: "Shall we keep still or shall we fight?"</span><br>
    The Clock of Fate has struck; the hour is here;<br>
    <span class="c2">War is upon us now&mdash;not far away;</span><br>
    One question only rises, clarion clear:<br>
    "How may I serve my country, day by day?"</p>

    <p>Not all of us may join the khakied throng<br>
    <span class="c2">Of those who answer and go forth to stem</span><br>
    The tide of war. But we can all be strong<br>
    <span class="c2">And steady in our loyalty to them!</span><br>
    Not with unfettered thought, or tongue let loose<br>
    <span class="c2">In bitterness and hate&mdash;a childish game!</span><br>
    But with a faith, untroubled by abuse,<br>
    <span class="c2">That honors those who put the rest to shame!</span></p>

    <p>There is no middle ground on which to stand;<br>
    <span class="c2">We've done with useless pro-and-con debates;</span><br>
    The one-time friend, so welcome in this land,<br>
    <span class="c2">Has turned upon us at our very gates.</span><br>
    There is no way, with honor, to stand back&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Real patriotism isn't cool&mdash;then hot;</span><br>
    You cannot trim the flag to fit your lack;<br>
    <span class="c2">You are American&mdash;or else you're not!</span></p><a name="pg_11" id="pg_11"></a>

    <h4>THE OLD NATIONAL GUARD</h4>

    <p>You pull a lot of funny stuff about us, when there's peace,<br>
    <span class="c2">The jokes you spring are sometimes rough, and make a guy see red;</span><br>
    But when there's trouble in the air you "vaudevillians" cease,<br>
    <span class="c2">And them that laughed the loudest laugh, salute the flag instead!</span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">Oh, it's kid the boys along</span><br>
    <span class="c2">When there's nothing going wrong;</span><br>
    <span class="c3">But when your country's facin' war,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">You sing a different song!</span></p>

    <p>The khaki that they doll us in ain't seen war service&mdash;no!<br>
    <span class="c2">The most of it has been worn thin a-loafin' 'round the mess;</span><br>
    Folks think it's great to josh us when things are goin' slow,<br>
    <span class="c2">But when the country's all het up&mdash;we ain't so worse, I guess!</span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">Then it's, "Look! The Guard is here;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Fine set of men, muh dear."...</span><br>
    <span class="c2">(We'd like it better if you spread</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Your jollies through th' year!)</span></p>

    <p>We're only folks&mdash;th' reg'lar kind&mdash;that answered to th' call;<br>
    <span class="c2">We may be dumb and also blind&mdash;but still we'll see it through!</span><br>
    Just wearin' khaki doesn't change our insides&mdash;not a'tall!<br>
    <span class="c2">We're human (Does that seem so strange?) waitin' to fight&mdash;for you!</span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">We mayn't be worth a cuss</span><br>
    <span class="c2">In this ugly foreign muss,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">But when the nation needs some help,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Why&mdash;pass the job to us!</span></p><a name="pg_13" id="pg_13"></a>

    <h4>THE ALIEN</h4>

    <div class="c4">
      <p>(Of course, this didn't happen,<br>
      But if it had&mdash;<br>
      Would you have been shocked?)</p>
    </div>

    <p>She was a pretty little thing,<br>
    Round-headed, bronze-haired and trim<br>
    As a yacht.<br>
    And when she married a handsome, polished Prussian<br>
    (Before the war was ours)<br>
    Her friends all said<br>
    She'd made no mistake.<br>
    He had much money, and he wasn't arrogant&mdash;<br>
    To her.<br>
    Their baby came&mdash;<br>
    Big and blue-eyed,<br>
    Solemn and serious,<br>
    With his father's arrogance in the small.<br>
    She knew how wonderful a child he was<br>
    And said so.<br>
    The husband knew it, too&mdash;<br>
    Because the child looked like him,<br>
    And they were happy<br>
    Until the Nation roused itself,<br>
    Stretched and yawned<br>
    And got into the hellish game of kill.<br>
    Then the man,<br>
    Who had been almost human,<br>
    Dropped his mask,<br>
    And uncovered his ragged soul.</p>

    <p>Having no sense of right or wrong&mdash;<br>
    No spiritual standards for measurements;<br>
    Feeding upon that same egotism<br>
    That swept his country<br>
    Into the depths of hate&mdash;<br>
    He sneered and laughed<br>
    At her pale patriotism<br>
    And the country that inspired it.<br>
    There was no open break between them,<br>
    For a child's small hands<br>
    Clung to both and kept them close.<br>
    Shutting her eyes to all else<br>
    Save that she was his wife,<br>
    She played her part well.<br>
    His work&mdash;his bluff at work, instead&mdash;<br>
    Was something big and important<br>
    (Always he looked the importance)<br>
    That had to do with ships&mdash;<br>
    Ships that idled at their docks to-day<br>
    Because they were interned.<br>
    And there was always money&mdash;<br>
    More money than she had ever known,&mdash;<br>
    Which he lavished&mdash;on himself<br>
    And his desires.</p>

    <p>Not that he gave her nothing,<br>
    For he did....<br>
    They lived in a big hotel,<br>
    And the child had everything it should have<br>
    And much it should not.<br>
    She, too, was cared for well,<br>
    After his wants were satisfied.</p>

    <p>Then&mdash;<br>
    The silent blow fell.<br>
    Secret service men called upon him,<br>
    And next day he was taken away<br>
    To a detention camp<br>
    For alien enemies.<br>
    Interned like the anchor-chafing ships<br>
    That once had flown his flag!<br>
    The woman, up in arms, dinned at officials<br>
    Until (so easy-going and so slow to learn)<br>
    They told her what he had done.<br>
    That night she stared long at their child, asleep,<br>
    And at its father's picture,<br>
    On her dresser....<br>
    Did the wife-courage that transcends<br>
    All other kinds of bravery<br>
    Keep her awake for hours,<br>
    Planning, scheming, thinking?</p>

    <hr>

    <p>A week later she and the child&mdash;<br>
    A blue-eyed, self-assertive mite&mdash;<br>
    Were at the camp,<br>
    She carrying it (the nurse was left behind)<br>
    And the passports that allowed her to see him<br>
    One hour, with a guard five yards away.<br>
    Some of his polite impudence was gone,<br>
    Yet he threw back his head and shoulders<br>
    And shrugged as his wife and boy came in.<br>
    "Always late," said he, after a perfunctory kiss,<br>
    "You&mdash;and your country!"<br>
    She stared long at him, holding the child close,<br>
    Her own round, bronze head bowed.</p>

    <p>Then, with a swift glance at the guard<br>
    Thoughtfully chewing a straw and looking<br>
    At the city of shacks,<br>
    She spoke.<br>
    "Did you know, Karl," she whispered,<br>
    "That my brother was on that transport&mdash;<br>
    My only brother&mdash;a soldier&mdash;my only blood?<br>
    If it had gone down&mdash;that transport&mdash;been sunk&mdash;"<br>
    "Well?" said he. That was all.<br>
    "My brother&mdash;my only&mdash;Karl!"<br>
    "Well?" said he again. "What of it?"<br>
    Then&mdash;her little head lifted, her eyes gone mad&mdash;<br>
    "This!" she said. "Rather than give<br>
    Life to another human scorpion like you&mdash;<br>
    Man in form only!&mdash;Lower than the floor of hell itself;<br>
    Rather than have my blood mingle with<br>
    The foul poison that is yours,<br>
    To make a child of ours&mdash;<br>
    This: I give him back to you&mdash;<br>
    And recall my love&mdash;all of my love!"<br>

    She whipped a hat-pin from her dainty hat,<br>
    Drove it with steady aim<br>
    Into the baby's heart<br>

    All that was left of what had once meant joy&mdash;<br>

    <span class="c2">They had him workin' like a Turk, th' pore, astonished worm.</span></p>

    <p>The rest of us, we gotta eat, and Jimmy&mdash;he can cook!<br>

    But where he shines is when we eat; the grub that Jimmy shoots<br>
    <span class="c2">At hungry troopers every day is certainly "some chow."</span></p>

    <h4>THE SANDWICH GIRL</h4>

    <p>This is the story as told to me;<br>
    <span class="c3">It may be a fairy-tale new,</span><br>
    But I know the man, and I know that he lies<br>
    <span class="c3">Very infrequently, too!</span></p>

    <p>When the boys in khaki first were called to serve,<br>
    <span class="c2">Guarding railroad bridges and the like,</span><br>
    Bob was just a private in the old N. G.,<br>
    <span class="c2">Fond of all the work&mdash;except the hike.</span><br>
    When they sent his comp'ny down the road a bit,<br>
    <span class="c2">"Gee!" he said, "I'd like to commandeer</span><br>
    Some one's car and drive it&mdash;marching gets my goat!"<br>
    <span class="c2">(Bob was quite a gas-car engineer.)</span></p>

    <p>Lonesome work, this pacing up and down a bridge.<br>
    <span class="c2">Now and then a loaded train goes by;</span><br>
    But at night&mdash;just nothing; everything was dead;<br>
    <span class="c2">Empty world beneath an empty sky.</span><br>
    Then the chauffeur lady got into the game,<br>
    <span class="c2">Drove her car each midnight to our tents,</span><br>
    Bringing us hot coffee, sandwiches, and pie;<br>
    <span class="c2">All the others thought that was immense.</span></p>

    <p>But Bob, ungrateful cuss, he would never say,<br>
    <span class="c2">Like the rest, that she had saved their lives;</span><br>
    He was too blamed busy, like the one-armed man<br>
    <span class="c2">Papering&mdash;the one that had the hives!</span><br>
    Bob would eat the lunches&mdash;eat and come again,<br>
    <span class="c2">Silent, but as hungry as a pup;</span><br>
    Finish with a piece o' pie, swallow it&mdash;and go;<br>
    <span class="c2">Never had to make him hurry up!</span></p>

    <p>Then one night we heard him talking to the girl,<br>
    <span class="c2">Like he was complaining to her: "Say!</span><br>
    Can't you change the stuffing? I am sick of ham!<br>
    <span class="c2">Have a heart! I'd just as lief eat hay!"</span><br>
    Did we all jump on him? You can bet we did:<br>
    <span class="c2">"Who gave you the right to kick, you steer,</span><br>
    Over what she brings us? She's a first-rate pal;<br>
    <span class="c2">Talk some more and get her on her ear!"</span></p>

    <p>Bob was somewhat flustered; thought we hadn't heard.<br>
    <span class="c2">Then he said, "Well, ain't you tired o' ham?"</span><br>
    "What of that?" says Wilcox. "Think of how she works!<br>
    <span class="c2">Spends her cash...!" (All Bob said then was, "Damn!")</span><br>
    Grabbing up his Springfield, "Listen, you!" he snaps.<br>
    <span class="c2">"That's my motor and my gasoline.</span><br>
    Sure she's spending money&mdash;but it comes from me;<br>
    <span class="c2">She's my sister, and her name's Irene!"</span></p>

    <p>Then, as he marched himself into the night,<br>
    <span class="c2">We looked at each other a spell.</span><br>
    "We've ditched our good luck&mdash;he won't <em>let</em> her come back,"<br>

    <span class="c2">(I know he'll be sea-sick, pore kid!)</span><br>
    But he said, "If I stayed, they'd call me afraid;<br>
    <span class="c2">I gotta sign up"&mdash;and he did.</span><br>
    So now I sit here, sorter dreamin'<br>
    <span class="c2">Of the days he was mine. They are done&mdash;</span><br>
    I'm proud; but I wish&mdash;I could fix up a dish<br>
    <span class="c2">Of doughnuts for Johnny, my son!</span></p><a name="pg_34" id="pg_34"></a>

    <h4>THE FIRST FLEET</h4>

    <p>We slid into the harbor here,<br>
    <span class="c2">A line of battle-cruisers gray,</span><br>
    With hungry guns as silent as<br>
    <span class="c2">The bands aboard that did not play.</span><br>
    The fog was soft, the fog was damp,<br>
    <span class="c2">The hush was thick and wide as space,</span><br>
    But ev'ry man was standing at<br>
    <span class="c2">Attention in his given place.</span></p>

    <p>We'd made the port, with time to spare&mdash;<br>
    And Uncle Sam's first Fleet was there!</p>

    <p>Then came those other navy men&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Our allies in this troubled cause&mdash;</span><br>
    Weary of holding back the Hun,<br>
    <span class="c2">Clipping, too slow, his cruel claws.</span><br>
    Our Admiral, a few-words man,<br>
    <span class="c2">Greeted the visitors.... "We're here,"</span><br>
    He said, and that was all. They smiled&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">And said they hoped the weather'd clear.</span></p>

    <p>But still those men with tired eyes<br>
    Felt mighty grateful, I surmise!</p>

    <p>Around our Fleet&mdash;not very large&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">We took them, thoughtful faces set;</span><br>
    And then back to the fog-soaked town<br>
    <span class="c2">They went&mdash;uncomfortably wet;</span><br>
    But in those eyes a happier light,<br>
    <span class="c2">That told him what they'd like to say&mdash;</span><br>
    That they were glad he had come back,<br>
    <span class="c2">As he had hoped to do some day.</span></p>

    <p>Another fleet, with fresher men,<br>
    Gave them a chance to breathe again!</p>

    <p>Before they left to go ashore<br>
    <span class="c2">(A crowd had gathered on the quay),</span><br>
    "When can you start to work?" they asked.<br>
    <span class="c2">"How many hours will it be</span><br>
    Before you're ready?" With a smile<br>
    <span class="c2">Our fighting Admiral replied</span><br>
    (And there was joy in what he said,<br>
    <span class="c2">Mingled with pardonable pride):</span></p>

    <p>"Soon as the enemy we meet!...<br>
    We're ready now&mdash;men, guns, and Fleet."</p>

    <p>So that is how we started in<br>
    <span class="c2">To do our share&mdash;the Navy's "bit";</span><br>
    They were surprised, but Admiral Sims<br>
    <span class="c2">Had surely made a three-base hit</span><br>
    With what he said.... And now it's up<br>
    <span class="c2">To us to do our hearty best</span><br>
    To make the seas the old-time seas;<br>
    <span class="c2">Till that is done there'll be no rest.</span></p>

    <p>It is a job to stop the Hun,<br>
    But&mdash;it's a job that must be done!</p><a name="pg_36" id="pg_36"></a>

    <h4>BRIGGS OF BASE No. 8</h4>

    <p>It may be that you know him. A slim and likely kid;<br>
    <span class="c2">Red-headed, tall, and soft of speech and glance.</span><br>
    He never took a prize at school (his talents always hid),<br>
    <span class="c2">And yet he's got a medal from the Government of France!</span></p>

    <div class="c6">
      <p>He didn't kill a lot of men;<br>
      <span class="c2">He never injured one;</span><br>
      He didn't hold a trench alone;<br>
      <span class="c2">He never manned a gun;</span><br>
      He drove an ambulance&mdash;that's all;<br>
      <span class="c2">But those above him knew</span><br>
      He'd take it into hell and back<br>
      <span class="c2">If he was ordered to!</span></p>

      <p>That night (he'd been right on the job<br>
      <span class="c2">For twenty hours or more)</span><br>
      They telephoned again for him&mdash;<br>
      <span class="c2">And as he cranked&mdash;he swore.</span><br>
      Half dead for sleep, he drove too far,<br>
      <span class="c2">Straight into No Man's Land,</span><br>
      And there he gathered up four men<br>
      <span class="c2">Who didn't understand</span><br>
      Or care what happened.... Then a chap<br>
      <span class="c2">Sagging with gobs of mud</span><br>
      He shoved into his throbbing car<br>
      <span class="c2">That smelled of drugs and blood.</span></p>

      <p>The other roared, but Briggs, sleep-deaf,<br>
      <span class="c2">Stared at the moon on high&mdash;</span><br>
      'Twas like some spent star-shell glued on<br>
      <span class="c2">A blue-black, tired sky&mdash;</span><br>
      And didn't try to hear or think;<br>
      <span class="c2">He only tried to keep</span><br>
      His car from sliding off the road&mdash;<br>
      <span class="c2">And not to fall asleep.</span><br>
      The ambulance went skidding back<br>
      <span class="c2">(His chains had lost themselves),</span><br>
      While now and then a growl came from<br>
      <span class="c2">Its stretcher-ladened shelves.</span><br>
      Briggs never stopped, but when the groans<br>
      <span class="c2">Were punctured with a curse</span><br>
      He told the weary moon, "At least<br>
      <span class="c2">This flivver is no hearse!"</span><br>
      And slowly yawned again.... At last<br>
      <span class="c2">They rounded Trouble Bend,</span><br>
      Base Eight before them&mdash;and that ride<br>
      <span class="c2">Was at a welcome end....</span><br>
      The blood-stained orderlies came out<br>
      <span class="c2">To take the wounded in,</span><br>
      Opened the doors to lift the wrecks....<br>
      <span class="c2">Before they could begin</span><br>
      There tumbled out the mud-caked man,<br>
      <span class="c2">Whose mouth was shot away;</span><br>
      A man who stared like some wild beast<br>
      <span class="c2">Finally brought to bay;</span><br>
      For Briggs, Base Eight, American,<br>
      <span class="c2">Had brought (beside his four)</span><br>
      A German officer, half drunk<br>
      <span class="c2">For need of rest! who swore</span><br>
      And cried, and then sank back again<br>
      <span class="c2">And fell asleep.... That's why</span><br>
      They've decorated little Briggs&mdash;<br>
      <span class="c2">Red-headed, tall, and shy!</span></p>

      <p>"I didn't do a thing," he growls;<br>
      <span class="c2">"'Twas just a fool mistake,</span><br>
      And he'd have captured me, of course,<br>
      <span class="c2">If <em>he</em> had been awake.</span><br>
      He tried to talk (his battered mouth<br>
      <span class="c2">Was just a shredded scar);</span><br>
      But we were wasting time, and so<br>
      <span class="c2">I pushed him in the car</span><br>
      And came on back.... Now, what is there<br>
      <span class="c2">About that sort of stuff</span><br>
      To make a fuss for? I am not<br>
      <span class="c2">A hero.... I'm a bluff!"</span><br>
      The surgeon smiles.... "If he can make<br>
      <span class="c2">A capture in the night</span><br>
      When doing Red Cross work, what would<br>
      <span class="c2">He do if he should <em>fight</em>?"</span><br>
      He asks, and looks a long way off<br>
      <span class="c2">To where the pounding guns</span><br>
      Are making other harmless wrecks<br>
      <span class="c2">Of one-time hellish Huns.</span></p>
    </div>

    <p>I wonder if you know him? A slim and quiet kid,<br>
    <span class="c2">Red-headed, tall, and soft of speech and glance;</span><br>
    He doesn't like to have you talk about the thing he did&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">And yet he's got a medal from the Government of France.</span></p><a name="pg_39" id="pg_39"></a>

    <h4>THE PENGUIN DRIVER</h4>

    <p>At home, he drove a taxi,<br>
    <span class="c2">A job he'd now disdain;</span><br>
    He's learning (on a queer machine)<br>
    <span class="c2">To drive an aeroplane.</span><br>
    It doesn't fly&mdash;it glumps along<br>
    <span class="c2">And bumps him, ev'ry chance;</span><br>
    His tumbling, rumbling "Penguin"<br>
    <span class="c2">Out there&mdash;Somewhere in France.</span></p>

    <p>It isn't fun to drive it,<br>
    <span class="c2">But he's not out for fun;</span><br>
    He's going to learn to drop good bombs<br>
    <span class="c2">Upon the no-good Hun!</span><br>
    And so, until he graduates,<br>
    <span class="c2">He makes his Penguin prance&mdash;</span><br>
    His bumping, jumping Penguin<br>
    <span class="c2">Out there&mdash;Somewhere in France.</span></p>

    <p>As soon as he's a pilot,<br>
    <span class="c2">(And earned his Golden Wings)</span><br>
    He'll take the air on high, you bet<br>
    <span class="c2">And do some bully things!</span><br>
    The Prussians will be sorry<br>
    <span class="c2">He ever learned to dance</span><br>
    With a rearing, tearing Penguin<br>
    <span class="c2">Out there&mdash;Somewhere in France.</span></p><a name="pg_40" id="pg_40"></a>

    <h4>WAITIN'</h4>

    <p>Back of the Front in this durn trainin' camp,<br>
    <span class="c2">Day after day we are stuck, an' we swear</span><br>
    Whenever we hear th' regular tramp<br>

    <span class="c2">We're all of us willin', but why keep us drillin'</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Forever?... Just waitin' for somethin' to do!</span></p>

    <p>At home they are readin' th' outlandish name<br>
    <span class="c2">Of a battle that's won or a hero that's dead</span><br>
    Of a stunt that had won him a place in this Game&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">But all that I've won is a cold in my head!</span><br>
    <span class="c2">While others are fightin' we're readin' or writin'&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">An' the censors will see that it don't get to you!</span></p>

    <p>We long for a scrap that will sizzle the blood;<br>

    <p>All set for a mix-up that we can't begin;<br>
    <span class="c2">Ready and anxious for whatever comes,</span><br>
    We're linked to the side-lines.... Ain't it a sin,<br>
    <span class="c2">Spendin' good hours a-twiddlin' thumbs?</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Seems like a crime to waste so much time</span><br>
    <span class="c2">A-waitin'&mdash;an' waitin'! You'd find it so, too.</span></p>

    <p>My bunkie is peevish, and I'm out of tune;<br>

    <span class="c2">We signed for a scrap, not a tea or a nap,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Or to wait,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And to wait,</span><br>

    <h4>THE SOUL OF SERGEANT TODD</h4>

    <p>"I wasn't so much of a soldier," said the soul of Sergeant Todd,<br>
    (Fumbling at his medal, that statement sounded odd.)<br>
    "I wasn't so much of a fighter, but when they came, and came,<br>
    Yelling and shooting, I just got mad, and I reckon I did the same.<br>
    <span class="c2">Into my trench they piled&mdash;just boys&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Making a most outlandish noise."</span></p>

    <p>A Corporal's soul beside him nodded and mustered a smile:<br>
    "You handled a dozen at once," he said; "they didn't come single file.<br>
    If you wasn't 'much of a soldier,' or shirked in your duty&mdash;well, say,<br>
    What sort of a chance have other men got when tested on Judgment Day?<br>
    <span class="c2">You fought them all, you did; and when</span><br>
    <span class="c2">They quit, you started in again!"</span></p>

    <p>"Shut up!" said the soul of Sergeant Todd; "you're still in my squad, McQuade,<br>
    I say that I lacked what you did not lack&mdash;courage to die, unafraid.<br>
    I was a coward, a trembling coward, deep in my craven heart;<br>
    I fought with the fear of that fear at my soul, playing no hero's part!<br>
    <span class="c2">You can't understand it&mdash;but I</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Had none of the courage&mdash;<em>to die!</em></span></p>

    <p>"And now that I'm dead," said the troubled soul of the one-time Sergeant Todd,<br>
    "It didn't seem right that those who live should think I have met our God<br>
    As a brave man does: his honor clear, with his courage unscathed and whole.<br>
    On this high plane there is no room for a fear-troubled human soul;<br>
    <span class="c2">So Sergeant Todd" (he bowed his head)</span><br>
    <span class="c2">"<em>Fears no more</em>&mdash;for his body's dead!"</span></p><a name="pg_47" id="pg_47"></a>

    <h4>THE BUSY LADY</h4>

    <p>We meet ev'ry week to make surgical dressings&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">And one woman does it dead wrong;</span><br>
    I watched her a day&mdash;then I just <em>had</em> to say,<br>
    <span class="c2">"My dear! If I may&mdash;that's too long!"</span><br>
    While I was explaining the teacher came by&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">She's so cross that her mouth's just a <em>line</em>&mdash;</span><br>
    And found fault with me and my work....<br>
    <span class="c3">After that</span><br>
    <span class="c2">I'll mind <em>no one's</em> business <em>but mine!</em></span></p>

    <p>To-day I was filling my neighbor's slow mind<br>
    <span class="c2">With War-Garden ideas and lore,</span><br>
    When a dog I don't <em>know</em> just <em>ruined</em> mine&mdash;so<br>
    <span class="c2">I'll not advise <em>her</em> any more!</span><br>
    Then a talk that I gave to the Home Service Group<br>
    <span class="c2">On "Waste" was <em>quite</em> spoiled&mdash;though 'twas fine&mdash;</span><br>
    By my bread burning up while I talked....<br>
    <span class="c3">After this</span><br>
    <span class="c2">I'll mind <em>no one's</em> business but <em>mine!</em></span></p>

    <p>At a lecture on "Hospital Units at Work"<br>
    <span class="c2">A woman (who looked fifty-three)</span><br>
    Ere the talk had <em>begun</em> started <em>crying</em>.... Her son<br>
    <span class="c2">Has gone, she confided to me.</span><br>
    "But you should be <em>brave</em> and 'buck up'," I remarked.<br>
    <span class="c2">"And <em>yours</em>?" she asked.... How did she divine</span><br>
    That <em>I</em> am not married?... Oh, well, after this<br>
    <span class="c2">I'll mind <em>no one's</em> business&mdash;b-but mine!</span></p><a name="pg_49" id="pg_49"></a>

    <h4>OVERDOING IT</h4>

    <p>This horrid old war is right <em>in</em> our house<br>
    <span class="c2">Making itself <em>at home</em>, goodness sakes!</span><br>
    The scraps from our table won't feed a <em>mouse</em><br>
    <span class="c2">We've cut out desserts, salads, and cakes.</span><br>
    Monday is meatless and Tuesday is dry,<br>
    <span class="c2">Wednesday is <em>sugarless</em>, too, gee whiz!</span><br>
    Our plates must be <em>cleaned</em>, they tell us. That's why<br>
    <span class="c2">We <em>eat</em> the garbage before it <em>is</em>!</span></p>

    <p>So I bought a melon the other day<br>
    <span class="c2">When ma was 'tending a Red Cross tea.</span><br>
    I wanted it <em>awful</em> bad.... Anyway<br>
    <span class="c2">It wasn't so <em>big</em>&mdash;just right for me&mdash;</span><br>
    And then, just to keep from wasting a <em>drop</em>,<br>
    <span class="c2">I <em>ate it all up!</em>... Our colored Liz</span><br>
    Says Pa told the doctor, "My fault, old top&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">"'We eat the garbage before it is.'"</span></p>

    <p>The doctor was writing a 'scription note<br>
    <span class="c2">When I come to, turned over and grinned,</span><br>
    And he frowned at Pa, as he wrote and wrote,<br>
    <span class="c2">Till Pa grew red like his cheeks was <em>skinned</em>.</span><br>
    "Eating the garbage? Now, listen, man,<br>
    <span class="c2">If that's your game it's good for <em>my</em> biz.</span><br>
    But if <em>I</em> was <em>you</em>, I surely would 'can'<br>
    <span class="c2">"'We eat the garbage before it is!'"</span></p><a name="pg_50" id="pg_50"></a>

    <h4>THE GIVERS</h4>

    <p><em>"I've given a lot of my time and work<br>
    <span class="c2">To helping my country," says he;</span><br>

    <p><span class="c2">John Lampas was a Greek,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">John Lampas isn't now;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">He's just a plain American</span><br>
    <span class="c3">And eating soldier chow.</span><br>
    <span class="c2">He joined the army recently,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">But first&mdash;he gave away</span><br>
    <span class="c2">His touring car, his watch, his cash</span><br>
    <span class="c3">To the Red Cross one day,</span><br>
    And then enlisted. "That's all I can do,"<br>
    He said; "and I'm glad to give it, for true!"</p>

    <p><span class="c2">He doesn't ask for praise,</span><br>

    <span class="c2">He gave because this land gave him</span><br>

    <h4>HULLO, SOLDIER! HOW'S THE BOY?</h4>

    <p>We're not a bit deluded by the notion<br>
    <span class="c2">That this is just a picnic, or that we</span><br>
    Enlisted for a trip across the ocean&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">There's work ahead, not just a joyous spree.</span><br>
    Of course we sing and talk and sometimes dance;<br>
    <span class="c2">But get this in your mind&mdash;that when we hear</span><br>
    "Hullo, Soldier! How's the boy?" as we disembark in France,<br>
    <span class="c2"><em>They</em> will hear us answer, "Ready!"</span><br>
    <span class="c9">Loud and clear;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">They will see that we <em>are</em> ready,</span><br>
    <span class="c9">Never fear.</span></p>

    <p>Don't you think that we are just a bunch of flivvers;<br>
    <span class="c2">We've measured up the job that must be done</span><br>
    And we know what we are facing, though the shivers<br>
    <span class="c2">Don't turn our spines to rubber&mdash;not a one!</span><br>
    The Prussian scorned the world. Well, let him scorn it<br>
    <span class="c2">(The world exchanges loathing for that scorn);</span><br>
    We haven't put on khaki to adorn it,<br>
    <span class="c2">But to make the Prussian sorry</span><br>
    <span class="c9">He was born;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And to send him back, his "Kultur"</span><br>
    <span class="c9">Banner torn!</span></p>

    <p>So it doesn't matter that some foolish people<br>
    <span class="c2">Bemoan the fact this Army's on the go;</span><br>
    Unless it <em>is</em>, the harvest they will reap'll<br>
    <span class="c2">Be slavery or death, they ought to know.</span><br>
    It isn't what they want or what we'd like&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">It's what we've <em>got</em> to do.... When others say,</span><br>
    "Hullo, Soldier! How's the boy?" as we drill and shoot and hike,<br>
    <span class="c2">They must hear us answer, "Ready!"</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Ev'ry day,</span><br>
    <span class="c2"><em>It's this nation's debt to France we've</em><br>
    <span class="c9">Come to pay!</span></span></p><a name="pg_54" id="pg_54"></a>

    <h4>BEANS</h4>

    <p>A simple ditty Private Smithy sang for me,<br>
    <span class="c2">Entitled "Beans."... The tune was not a joy;<br>
    The words were commonplace as they could be,<br>
    <span class="c2">But just to hear his earnest voice&mdash;"Oh, Boy!"</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">When first I went a-sojerin'</span><br>
    <span class="c3">I couldn't eat the stuff</span><br>
    <span class="c2">The cookies gave the bunch of us,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">For it was rough and tough.</span><br>
    <span class="c2">But since I've been a-sojerin'</span><br>
    <span class="c3">And learned what <em>livin'</em> means</span><br>
    <span class="c2">The grub we get tastes mighty good,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">E-special-lee th' beans,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Especially th' beans!</span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">We all were soft and flabby&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Our hands and muscles, too&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">We had been used to easy things</span><br>
    <span class="c3">To eat, to think, to do.</span><br>
    <span class="c2">But when we tackled trench work,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">With all that diggin' means,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">We learned to like the sojer grub,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">E-special-lee th' beans,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Especially th' beans.</span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">So now we're very diff'rent</span><br>
    <span class="c3">When mess-call comes around;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">We've got our appetites all set</span><br>
    <span class="c3">A-waitin' for that sound;&gt;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">It's always "second helpin's"</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Behind the mess-tent screens;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">We're glad for Uncle Sam's good grub,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">E-special-lee th' beans,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Especially th' beans!</span></p>

    <p>A very simple ditty, you'll agree with me;<br>
    <span class="c2">A commonplace production; but the joy</span><br>
    And unction that he puts into the melody,<br>
    <span class="c2">The <em>splendid appetite</em> he sings&mdash;Oh, Boy!</span></p><a name="pg_56" id="pg_56"></a>

    <h4>BEHIND THE LINES</h4>

    <p>We number hundreds of thousands, and we're nowhere near the front;<br>
    <span class="c2">We're pen and pencil pushers, or "serving" the adding machines;</span><br>
    We'll never reach the firing-line, nor bear its hellish brunt&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">But where'd <em>they</em> be if it weren't for us, workers behind the scenes?</span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">Book-keeper, paymaster, spectacled clerk,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Doing our bit, though it's every day work&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c3">We're all of us part of The Service!</span></p>

    <p>We're the backwash whirl of the pool of War gathering in the men,<br>
    <span class="c2">We cannot fight as others fight, though just as loyal and true;</span><br>
    We're the silent corps of the Men Behind, over and over again<br>
    <span class="c2">Doing our part in the war for Right, small though it seem to you.</span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">Figuring, checking-up, testing all day,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Knowing no hours&mdash;and not too much pay&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c3">We're all of us part of The Service.</span></p>

    <p>If it takes ten men behind the front to put one on the Line,<br>
    <span class="c3">(We all remember the speech that cheers the backwash, anyhow!)</span><br>
    We're putting them there&mdash;and do not ask for furloughs.... That's a sign<br>
    <span class="c2">We're not the <em>guests</em> of the Government&mdash;<em>we're in The Service now.</em></span></p>

    <p><span class="c2">A cog in the big machine? Maybe&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">But a cog that doesn't complain, you see&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c3">We're <em>all</em> of us part of The Service!</span></p><a name="pg_58" id="pg_58"></a>

    <h4>THE DISAPPOINTED</h4>

    <p>There's a Red Cross Button on his left lapel,<br>
    <span class="c2">And a Liberty Bond pin on his right;</span><br>
    There's a U. S. flag above the Red Cross, too;<br>
    <span class="c2">His patriotism's never out of sight!</span><br>
    His loyalty is spread on his hollow breast<br>
    <span class="c2">(And sometimes he's pathetic, I confess),</span><br>
    But the button that he's most ashamed to wear<br>
    <span class="c2">Is the one that reads</span></p>

    <div class="c10">
      <p>EXEMPT<br>
      <span class="c2">U. S.</span></p>
    </div>

    <p>There's an aching heart in his 28-chest,<br>
    <span class="c2">There's a look of deep longing in his eyes;</span><br>
    Behind his heavy glasses there gleams a hope<br>
    <span class="c2">That maybe he can grow an inch in size!</span><br>
    There's a hero-throb in the heart of that boy,<br>
    <span class="c2">Though he wears too much "scenery"&mdash;ah, yes!&mdash;</span><br>
    But the badge that hurts he really tries to hide&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">It's the one that reads</span></p>

    <div class="c10">
      <p>EXEMPT<br>
      <span class="c2">U. S.</span></p>
    </div>

    <p>You fellows that are in&mdash;have a heart for those<br>
    <span class="c2">Who want to be, but can't! For they must know</span><br>
    A bitterness of soul you can never feel&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2"><em>They</em> haven't got a chance on earth to go!</span><br>
    So it's, "Stay back home with the old and unfit,"<br>
    <span class="c2">(There's nothing else to do but that, I guess!)</span><br>
    The badge he'd be glad to throw a mile away<br>
    <span class="c2">Is the one that reads</span></p>

    <div class="c10">
      <p>EXEMPT<br>

    <h4>GOODBYE, BOYS!</h4>

    <p>Line after line, you swung along,<br>
    <span class="c2">You men, who only a while ago</span><br>
    Were just a part of the city's throng<br>
    <span class="c2">Working for self, sedate and slow.</span><br>
    But now&mdash;what a diff'rence! Living throbs<br>
    <span class="c2">Of the Nation's heart! Her reborn men;</span><br>
    And some who saw you gulped back sobs&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">And wished you were marching home again!</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Our eyes were dim as you went past,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">For we <em>knew you</em>&mdash;at last!</span></p>

    <p>We felt that every senseless joke<br>
    <span class="c2">About a soldier, wherever made,</span><br>
    Would make <em>us</em> ashamed.... For now we choke<br>
    <span class="c2">Whenever the Colors and <em>you</em> parade!</span><br>
    Wherever that O. D. uniform<br>
    <span class="c2">Shall gladden the eyes of we useless men</span><br>
    We can't forget who is meeting the storm&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">That some of you won't come home again!</span><br>
    <span class="c3">You went.... We talked.... God blot the past!</span><br>
    <span class="c3">For <em>we</em> know <em>you</em>&mdash;at last!</span></p><a name="pg_61" id="pg_61"></a>

    <h4>THAT'S ALL</h4>

    <p>To take this trouble seriously,<br>
    <span class="c2">But not to gloom or whine;</span><br>
    To never overestimate<br>
    <span class="c2">Our strength, or to decline</span><br>
    To see this is no picnic,<br>
    <span class="c2">But do our earnest part</span><br>
    With brain and muscles, newly trained&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">To keep a steady heart!</span></p>

    <p>To fight, but not to lower<br>
    <span class="c2">Our standards in the dust;</span><br>
    To meet a savage enemy<br>
    <span class="c2">Whose words the world can't trust.</span><br>
    To guard our foolish tempers&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Or keep them out of sight!</span><br>
    To never falter, doubt, or fear<br>
    <span class="c2">The outcome will be <em>right</em>!</span></p>

    <p>To laugh&mdash;whenever laughter<br>
    <span class="c2">Is best to keep us fit;</span><br>
    To shake hands with privation<br>
    <span class="c2">When face to face with it.</span><br>
    To give without complaining<br>
    <span class="c2">Or boasting what we give;</span><br>
    To make this world a safer world<br>
    <span class="c2">For those who have to live!</span></p>

    <p>To part with old traditions<br>
    <span class="c2">That hampered in the past;</span><br>
    To see that heart-wrung "aliens"<br>
    <span class="c2">As enemies aren't classed,</span><br>
    But treated&mdash;while deserving it&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">As human beings, too;</span></p><span class="c5">* * * * *</span>

    <p>Just to <em>be clean</em>&mdash;in mind and soul&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">That's <em>all</em> we have to do!</span></p><a name="pg_63" id="pg_63"></a>

    <h4>AN AMERICAN CREED</h4>

    <p><span class="c2">Straight thinking,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Straight talking,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Straight doing,</span><br>
    And a firm belief in the might of right.</p>

    <p><span class="c2">Patience linked with patriotism,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Justice added to kindliness,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Uncompromising devotion to this country,</span><br>
    And active, not passive, Americanism.</p>

    <p><span class="c2">To talk less, to mean more,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">To complain less, to accomplish more,</span><br>
    And to so live that every one of us is ready to<br>
    look Eternity in the face at any moment, and<br>
    be unafraid!</p>

    <h4>YOUTH O' THE YEAR</h4>

    <p>"Write me," she ordered, nodding her head,<br>
    <span class="c2">"A song of the rippling Spring that is gone&mdash;</span><br>
    A song that's different from songs that are dead&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Different as sunset is from the dawn.</span><br>
    Sparkling with happiness, heavy with dew,<br>
    Trilling and thrilling, all the way through;<br>
    Fill it with heaven's own laughing blue&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Write it!" she said. So I wrote it&mdash;"Love's Pawn."</span></p>

    <p>I spoke of the sunshine caught in her hair;<br>
    <span class="c2">I sang of the peach blossom's pink in her face;</span><br>
    I mentioned the heavenly blue with great care<br>
    <span class="c2">That colored her wonderful eyes. And her grace</span><br>
    I likened to that of a slender young tree<br>
    Bowing and laughing when breezes blow free;<br>
    In fact, there was naught in the Spring I could see<br>
    <span class="c2">Save this girl who with Love would ever keep pace.</span></p>

    <p>She took it and read it, that poor thing of mine&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Old as a saga, young as the year&mdash;</span><br>
    Drank in the similes (flattering wine!),<br>
    <span class="c2">Then gave her verdict, "You are a <em>dear</em>;</span><br>
    Surely no girl ever had such a song<br>
    Written for her; I will treasure it long;<br>
    It's <em>so</em> original&mdash;clever&mdash;and strong;<br>
    <span class="c2">How <em>could</em> you know me so well&mdash;in one year?"</span></p>

    <p>I read it myself&mdash;and grew red, I confess,<br>
    <span class="c2">As a good workman should, when a poor job is done;</span><br>
    But the joy of her laugh and the sweet, swift caress<br>
    <span class="c2">Overpaid me, a hundred to one!...</span><br>
    And then as she stood on the brow of the hill<br>
    And swayed in the wind, as Youth ever will,<br>
    I think that I heard her silv'ry laugh trill ...<br>
    <span class="c2">But perish the thought that she'd spoken in fun!</span></p><a name="pg_69" id="pg_69"></a>

    <h4>UNFINISHED</h4>

    <p>The radiant dawn flows up the empty sky,<br>
    <span class="c2">Its singing colors heralding the day,</span><br>
    And yet, before the tardy sun is high,<br>
    <span class="c2">Unfinished morning fades and slips away.</span><br>
    While Nature holds her fragrant breath at dawn<br>
    Watching the loveliness she's made&mdash;it's gone!</p>

    <p>From dew-drenched garden thrills a thrush's call&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">That liquid note that all night long was stilled&mdash;</span><br>
    The living chalice, brown and bright and small,<br>
    <span class="c2">Seems with the joy of living overfilled&mdash;</span><br>
    Then suddenly, unfinished, clear and sweet<br>
    The song is drowned in noises from the street.</p>

    <p>So at the edge of dusk my love for you<br>
    <span class="c2">Would speak to your white soul, would humbly come</span><br>
    To tell the age-old story, ever new&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">But in the pulsing twilight Love is dumb!</span><br>
    Oh, heart of mine, within your quiet breast<br>
    Unfinished dawn&mdash;and song&mdash;and love&mdash;find rest!</p><a name="pg_70" id="pg_70"></a>

    <h4>PAID IN ADVANCE</h4>

    <p>What is the cost of a day in Spring&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">A wind-swept, rain-washed golden day?</span><br>
    A day that with joy is bubbling&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">And dancing adown a world mad-gay?</span></p>

    <p>You've paid for that day with days gone by&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">The gloomy days and the days of rain;</span><br>
    The days that you'd like to forget&mdash;and try&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Days that were tuned to a note of pain.</span></p>

    <p>Others there are who will never forget<br>
    <span class="c2">The lowering clouds and the sodden world,</span><br>
    But&mdash;though you paid as they paid, eyes wet&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Your banner of courage was still unfurled!</span></p>

    <p>That was the price of this day in June,<br>
    <span class="c2">Paid in advance with a shrug and a smile&mdash;</span><br>
    While others complained, you heard a tune,<br>
    <span class="c2">Making the gloomiest day worth while!</span></p><a name="pg_71" id="pg_71"></a>

    <h4>WE RODE AT NIGHT</h4>

    <p>We rode at night, and the cut-steel stars<br>
    <span class="c2">Daggered the black of the quiet sky;</span><br>
    Yet Venus had taken the place of Mars<br>
    <span class="c2">In the Scheme of the Silent Worlds on high.</span><br>
    The ribbon of road ran straight ahead;<br>
    <span class="c2">The night air whipped your hair and your face,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Our hearts kept time to the horses' pace,</span><br>
    And we were alive, and our blood was red!</p>

    <p>We rode at night.... Though you did not speak<br>
    <span class="c2">I nearer drew&mdash;there was none to see&mdash;</span><br>
    Love lent me strength to an arm not weak,<br>
    <span class="c2">And I swept you out of your saddle&mdash;to me!</span><br>
    I rowelled your horse and he thundered on,<br>
    <span class="c2">While in my arms you cuddled, and sighed;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And I kissed your hair and lips&mdash;and lied</span><br>
    When you asked if the coming light was the dawn?</p>

    <p>We rode at night; and our love, new-found,<br>
    <span class="c2">Gloried our way, as the pace slowed down;</span><br>
    Heart against heart, your fingers wound<br>
    <span class="c2">Close about mine, ere we reached the town.</span><br>
    You cared, you cared! Though your firm white hand<br>
    <span class="c2">Was cut by the reins you had held too long,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">"Dear Cave-man, I love you," you said; "is it wrong?"</span><br>
    O, wonderful night in a wonderful land!</p>

    <p>We ride no more, for the years have fled,<br>
    <span class="c2">The wine of hot Youth is down to the lees;</span><br>
    Broken in body, I dream, instead,<br>
    <span class="c2">Of the gold-shot Past that age ever sees.</span><br>
    We ride no more.... Yet the scar is still there<br>
    <span class="c2">On the brave little hand that I kissed that night,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And my love is as strong as the hand is white;</span><br>
    But I wonder&mdash;I wonder&mdash;do you still care?</p><a name="pg_73" id="pg_73"></a>

    <h4>NOW&mdash;AND THEN</h4>

    <p>A thousand years from now, how will this earth<br>
    <span class="c2">Conduct itself? Will there be wars, and men</span><br>
    Inventing things? Or will there be a dearth<br>
    <span class="c2">Of ideas (such as we feel, now and then?)</span><br>
    Nobody knows. We can surmise, perchance&mdash;<br>
    But glancing that far oft is quite some glance!</p>

    <p>A thousand years from now&mdash;in Time's swift flight&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">The aeroplane itself may be passe,</span><br>
    And transportation on a beam of light<br>
    <span class="c2">The natural and the ordinary way.</span><br>
    Men may have bodies made of metals cold<br>
    To match the hearts and brains those bodies hold!</p>

    <p>A thousand years from now&mdash;why should we care<br>
    <span class="c2">What Science then brings forth&mdash;we won't be here</span><br>
    To worry over things or to compare<br>
    <span class="c2">The present with our past&mdash;won't that be queer?</span><br>
    But men, as now, will hope (as we have done)<br>
    That each new year will be a better one!</p><a name="pg_74" id="pg_74"></a>

    <h4>UNDERSTOOD</h4>

    <p>Out of the ruck and the roar of life<br>
    <span class="c2">He stepped aside to rest one day,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And the flowers that grew along the way</span><br>
    Lifted him out of the wearisome strife<br>
    <span class="c2">That had claimed his every waking thought</span><br>
    <span class="c2">For years ... and a miracle had been wrought!</span></p>

    <p>"Why have I never seen the rose<br>
    <span class="c2">Just as a <em>rose</em> before?" asked he.</span><br>
    <span class="c2">"Always its cost was the point to me,</span><br>
    And not its sweetness! Do you suppose<br>
    <span class="c2">That all these years&mdash;how long, God knows!&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">I really have not <em>understood</em> the rose?"</span></p>

    <p>Walking along the quiet street<br>
    <span class="c2">He noted a sick and fretting child;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And he waved his hand and paused and smiled</span><br>
    Till the baby laughed&mdash;and its laugh was sweet.<br>
    <span class="c2">His eyes were dim as his hand he kissed</span><br>
    <span class="c2">To the child, and he whispered, "And <em>that</em> I have missed!"</span></p>

    <p>To the end of the day that was full of care<br>
    <span class="c2">The song in his heart was strong and new,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And the woman who loved him heard it too:</span><br>
    "Now that his soul is awake, I dare<br>
    <span class="c2">Hope that he understands me," she said;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">But I fear he didn't&mdash;until he was dead!</span></p><a name="pg_75" id="pg_75"></a>

    <h4>THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT</h4>

    <p>"A Merry Christmas!" You who make each day<br>
    <span class="c2">A little less unhappy for some soul</span><br>
    Weighted with sorrow; you who have been gay<br>
    <span class="c2">For others' sake&mdash;although you paid the toll</span><br>
    In the still watches of the weary night,<br>
    <span class="c2">Fighting despair. You who have faced the world</span><br>
    With spirit and put cowardice to flight;<br>
    <span class="c2">You, with your rugged banner still unfurled&mdash;</span><br>
    "A Merry Christmas!" For in you I see<br>
    The Vision of the Man that I would be!</p>

    <p>"A Merry Christmas!" Through the winter chill,<br>
    <span class="c2">The singing spring&mdash;hot summer and drear fall,</span><br>
    You go your way, seeking for good, not ill,<br>
    <span class="c2">Remembering life's joy and not its gall;</span><br>
    Clasping the hand that trembles, when you may,<br>
    <span class="c2">Spending your love whole-heartedly the while</span><br>
    For those who need it <em>now</em>, nor wait that day<br>
    <span class="c2">When they no longer care for word or smile.</span><br>
    Doing your part with all sincerity&mdash;<br>
    A Vision of the Man that I would be!</p><a name="pg_76" id="pg_76"></a>

    <h4>THE REASON</h4>

    <p>The fetching airs you have; the way you sing, dear;<br>
    <span class="c2">The pretty uplift of your round, firm chin;</span><br>
    Into my heart the sunshine daily bring, dear;<br>
    <span class="c2">To be downcast when you're here were a sin!</span><br>
    Yet ev'ry motion, ev'ry smile and word, dear,<br>
    <span class="c2">I know full well&mdash;and lost are their effect.</span><br>
    All of your bell-like tones you see, I've heard, dear,<br>
    <span class="c2">When they were meant for me&mdash;and came direct.</span></p>

    <p>That golden hair! How well you know its worth, dear,<br>
    <span class="c2">To draw enraptured praise from lovers bold!</span><br>
    I, too, know well that from its very birth, dear,<br>
    <span class="c2">Its meshes have entrapped the young and old.</span><br>
    Yet, when I watch you laughing, teasing&mdash;you, dear,<br>
    <span class="c2">Who have been given such a hold on hearts,</span><br>
    I do not thrill as all the others do, dear;<br>
    <span class="c2">Lost on me (in a manner) are your arts!</span></p>

    <p>Not that I'm jealous, indifferent, or cold, dear;<br>
    <span class="c2">Not that I don't approve of all your charms;</span><br>
    Not that you're "just a little bit too old," dear;<br>
    <span class="c2">Nor that you are a tiny babe in arms!</span><br>
    No, no; you're sweet, and fresh, and fair, dear,<br>
    <span class="c2">Unspoiled, delightful&mdash;really "all the rage."</span><br>
    But somehow I can't seem to rightly care, dear&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">I wooed your mother&mdash;when she was your age!</span></p><a name="pg_77" id="pg_77"></a>

    <h4>THE MODERN WAY</h4>

    <p>Of tender missives&mdash;decorated treasures&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Of violets and roses, passing sweet;</span><br>
    Of throbbing heart-songs, tuned to lilting measures;<br>
    <span class="c2">Of fervent verse&mdash;with somewhat halting feet;</span><br>
    Of every dainty Valentine that's fashioned<br>
    <span class="c2">You've had a rather goodly share each year;</span><br>
    So will you take, in place of love-impassioned<br>
    <span class="c2">Epistles, something quieter, my dear?</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Three words I'll send&mdash;that is, if they're enough</span><br>
    <span class="c2">To take the place of all that flossy stuff!</span></p>

    <p>Throughout the year life is so full of trouble,<br>
    <span class="c2">Saint Valentine, alas! is shoved aside;</span><br>
    Beneath grim work the lover's back must double,<br>
    <span class="c2">And then he lets poor sentiment go slide!</span><br>
    We try to think of what you'd have us say, dear,<br>
    <span class="c2">But when we've coaxed a good thought half way out,</span><br>
    A money-making idea's in the way, dear,<br>
    <span class="c2">And then Love's gentle troops are put to rout.</span><br>
    <span class="c2">So&mdash;with a business missive in each hand&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Will three words do? Or do you more demand?</span></p>

    <p>Gone are the days when troubadors sang daily<br>
    <span class="c2">Of hearts and flowers, lips and eyes and hair;</span><br>
    We take (I fear) our deep emotions gaily,<br>
    <span class="c2">And think we haven't time to love or care.</span><br>
    Yet once a year it shouldn't be impossible<br>
    <span class="c2">To Valentine a little, that is true;</span><br>
    Then gloss the faults of mine you think are glossible,<br>
    <span class="c2">And I will troubador a bit for you;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">So, by the stars that shine above you,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Hark to my valentine, my dear, <em>I love you!</em></span></p><a name="pg_79" id="pg_79"></a>

    <h4>BECAUSE&mdash;!</h4>

    <p>This thing of writing "homely verse,"<br>
    <span class="c2">With country phrases, jokes and slang;</span><br>
    With "jiminies!" "by hecks!" and such,<br>
    <span class="c2">With "backwoods" odor, taste and tang&mdash;</span><br>
    This thing, I say, of making light<br>
    <span class="c2">Of country life is funny&mdash;Not!</span><br>
    I'd like to know where we would be<br>
    <span class="c2">If farms were all to go to pot!</span></p>

    <p>We talk a lot of "backyard farms,"<br>
    <span class="c2">"Intensive gard'ning"&mdash;"how to raise</span><br>
    All vegetables that you need<br>
    <span class="c2">On ten square feet in twenty days."</span><br>
    We figure fortunes that six hens<br>
    <span class="c2">Will bring us&mdash;if we keep 'em penned;</span><br>
    And yet, when farmers are the butt<br>
    <span class="c2">Of jokes, who rises to defend?</span></p>

    <p>I'm weary of this silly pose,<br>
    <span class="c2">This pseudo-humor, sickly wit;</span><br>
    I will not laugh or even smile<br>
    <span class="c2">When at the farmers jokesmiths hit.</span><br>
    Especially this time of year<br>
    <span class="c2">I do denounce it! (Uncle Jim</span><br>
    Out on his farm lives well&mdash;and he<br>
    <span class="c2">Has asked us all to visit him!)</span></p><a name="pg_80" id="pg_80"></a>

    <h4>THAT SMILE</h4>

    <p>I sure do like that kid, although I know<br>
    <span class="c2">He's rotten spoiled, and ought to be suppressed.</span><br>
    He's boiling over with boy-nonsense! So<br>
    <span class="c2">The neighbors have no chance to get a rest.</span><br>
    Not bad, you understand; just "some unlucky"<br>
    <span class="c2">In getting caught at things, once in a while;</span><br>
    Yet when he does, he never runs&mdash;he's plucky!<br>
    <span class="c2">But plays that smile of his, that flashing smile.</span></p>

    <p>Sometimes when he has done a foolish thing&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Like "hoeing weeds" with our best garden hose,</span><br>
    Or in the rose bed "built a min'rul spring,"<br>
    <span class="c2">He's bound to make me peevish, goodness knows!</span><br>
    Yet when he tries to "'splain it all" to me,<br>
    <span class="c2">I don't succumb a moment to his guile;</span><br>
    I'm stern, as stern, indeed, as I can be&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Until he smiles that mother-given smile!</span></p>

    <p>Perhaps he doesn't understand how strong<br>
    <span class="c2">A weapon he possesses&mdash;Gracious me!</span><br>
    Disarmed by it, I can not right the wrong<br>
    <span class="c2">By scolding him, however forcefully.</span><br>
    I do believe, if Fate itself were bent<br>
    <span class="c2">On breaking him, 'twould hesitate a while</span><br>
    And feel ashamed!... He wins without intent<br>
    <span class="c2">Because&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;he knows <em>when</em> to smile.</span></p><a name="pg_81" id="pg_81"></a>

    <h4>THE GIFT OF GIFTS</h4>

    <p>If Antoinette were sitting here before the cheery blaze,<br>
    <span class="c2">And she should ask me what I'd like to-morrow&mdash;day of days&mdash;</span><br>
    Would not my heart leap to my mouth, as any chap's would do,<br>
    <span class="c2">While leaning down to her pink ear, I softly whispered, "You!"</span></p>

    <p>If Antoinette were just to give me half a chance to say<br>
    <span class="c2">What gift of gifts I'd like the best, how long would I delay</span><br>
    In taking her into my arms and keeping her there, too,<br>
    <span class="c2">While earnestly I answer her with one brief, heartfelt "You!"</span></p>

    <p>If Antoinette, dear Antoinette, were simply to suggest<br>
    <span class="c2">That question, don't you think that I would quickly do the rest?</span><br>
    Well, you'd be wrong, because, alas! a year ago&mdash;or two&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">She asked Jim what he wanted, and the lucky chap said "You!"</span></p><a name="pg_82" id="pg_82"></a>

    <h4>THE NEIGHBORS</h4>

    <p>For years and years I practiced&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">Tum-tum, tum-tum, tee-tum!</span><br>
    Pounding up and down the scale,<br>
    White keys, black keys&mdash;<br>
    They all fell beneath my faithful hammering;<br>
    And then&mdash;my pretty neighbor across the street<br>
    Put in a player-piano that could tear a hole<br>
    Through classics that I'd never learned even to dent!<br>
    I was mad&mdash;hopping mad&mdash;<br>
    But I got even with her.<br>
    (She was studying for the operatic stage.)<br>
    I bought a phonograph&mdash;cheap&mdash;<br>
    And some records&mdash;not cheap.<br>
    They made her gargling voice<br>
    Sound like an imitation with a small i.<br>
    Then we both laughed&mdash;and quit our exercises.<br>
    To-day she's a moving picture actress,<br>
    Using her big eyes in a financially-effective way,<br>
    While I write things in prose or jingle<br>
    Or verse that is free-on-bail.<br>
    Sometimes I get by with it; and<br>
    Sometimes she doesn't spoil a film&mdash;<br>
    Isn't the public lucky that we didn't<br>
    Stick to our callings?</p><a name="pg_83" id="pg_83"></a>

    <h4>UNCLE BILL'S IDEA</h4>

    <p>I've figgered out that worryin' don't pay a little bit,<br>
    <span class="c2">Fer every feller's got to have some trouble in his day;<br>
    An' wonderin' what's comin' next don't help to sidetrack hit&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">You can't foretell afflictions, or stop 'em, thataway!<br>
    <span class="c3">It's better jest to take what's sent<br>
    <span class="c3">And stand it, ef you ain't content!</span></span></span></span></p>

    <p>Looks like to me that every one has got a large amount<br>
    <span class="c2">Of things to bear that he don't like, as through this life he goes;<br>
    And though of happy days we're apt to lose the rightful count,<br>
    <span class="c2">Things even up before we die, as every old man knows.<br>
    <span class="c3">There ain't no great monopoly<br>
    <span class="c3">On sickness ner bad luck, I gee!</span></span></span></span></p>

    <p>We've got to stand our share of pain and meet a heap of sorrow;<br>
    <span class="c2">We've got to shoulder burdens that no one likes to tote;<br>
    But worryin' about the load, and thinkin' of th' morrow<br>
    <span class="c2">Don't make it one mite easier, er cheerfuller, I note!<br>
    Th' way to do is jest t' grin<br>
    And hope for better times ag'in;<br>
    "But I <em>can't</em> grin!" some people say.<br>
    Then don't&mdash;but bear it, anyway!</span></span></p><a name="pg_85" id="pg_85"></a>

    <h4>'LIZABETH ANN'S PICTURE</h4>

    <p>Ma wanted a good, new picture of me; so pa says, "'Lizabeth Ann,<br>
    You come down town at noon to-day, and we'll go to the picture man;<br>
    But don't tell mother&mdash;we'll have a surprise for her on Christmas day,<br>
    And give her a real nice photograft&mdash;I know just what she will say."<br>
    "Oh, goody!" I says, "I am awful glad! I'll be there at noon, you see."<br>
    (I like to have a secret with pa&mdash;it's awful much fun for me.)</p>

    <p>I runned away at 'leven o'clock, and ma didn't see me go,<br>
    Although I had dressed in my very best&mdash;and that takes time, you know&mdash;<br>
    My party frock, and my best kid shoes; my furs and my "picture" hat,<br>
    And my new red coat&mdash;the one she says, "Be careful, my dear, of that."<br>
    And when I got to his office, pa looked awful surprised, and said,<br>
    "Dear me, what a dressed-up little girl! Why, really, you turn my head!"</p>

    <p>And then we went to the picture man. He's nice enough, I s'pose,<br>
    But what do you think he said to me? "You seem to be mostly clothes!"<br>
    So pa and the man made me <em>undress</em>, till all that I had on me<br>
    Was my shirtwaist slip&mdash;my arms and neck was bare as they both could be!<br>
    It made me feel umbarrassed! And then I guess that I nearly cried,<br>
    But pa just patted me on the head and said <em>he</em> was satisfied.</p>

    <p>And now the pictures are finished up, and one is already framed;<br>
    But ma'll be mad, I am pretty sure&mdash;I know that <em>I</em> feel ashamed;<br>
    For all that you see is my head and neck&mdash;and not a bit of my dress&mdash;<br>
    She'll think I was funny to go down-town with so little on, I guess!<br>
    Yet pa says, "Never you mind, my dear&mdash;blame it on me or the man;<br>
    But mother will like it, you see if she don't&mdash;she wanted <em>you</em>, 'Lizabeth Ann."</p><a name="pg_87" id="pg_87"></a>

    <h4>THE SMALL BOY EXPLAINS</h4>

    <p>Some people say the sky is blue<br>
    <span class="c2">Acause it's warshed by rains up there;</span><br>
    I dunno if 'at's so, do you?<br>
    <span class="c2">And I don't care&mdash;and I don't care!</span></p>

    <p>I ain't no sky, an' I don't like<br>
    <span class="c2">To have my face warshed, anyhow;</span><br>
    My nurse says I'm a "naughty tike<br>
    <span class="c2">To run away" or raise a row.</span></p>

    <p>But ef she daubed mud on like this<br>
    <span class="c2">A-purpose, so's the boys would play</span><br>
    With her&mdash;and not call her a "sis,"<br>
    <span class="c2">She'd hate to warsh it all away!</span></p>

    <p>That's why the blue sky'll never mean<br>
    <span class="c2">A in-spi-ra-tion er a "joy";</span><br>
    A-course it can be nice an' clean&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">It won't be called a "sissy-boy."</span></p><a name="pg_88" id="pg_88"></a>

    <h4>THE BOLD LOVER</h4>

    <p>He held her hand, and joy shone in his eyes;<br>
    <span class="c2">The world and all therein to him was fair;</span><br>
    What mattered now the gloomy, lowering skies?<br>
    <span class="c2">For what the future held he did not care!</span><br>
    He only knew he loved her and that she<br>
    Was everything a real sweetheart should be.</p>

    <p>He held her hand.... The car was crowded, too;<br>
    <span class="c2">The passengers could not suppress their smiles.</span><br>
    The love he felt, perhaps, obscured his view,<br>
    <span class="c2">So wrapt was he in all her pretty wiles.</span><br>
    And when he kissed her rosy lips, a hush<br>
    Fell on them as they saw her slowly blush!</p>

    <p>He held her hand and gazed about with pride,<br>
    <span class="c2">As though to challenge those who'd say him nay;</span><br>
    He held her hand&mdash;and nestling to her side,<br>
    <span class="c2">The interested audience heard him say;</span><br>
    "Oh, Momie, dear, you're sweet as any rose&mdash;<br>
    I love you more dan <em>any</em>body knows."</p><a name="pg_89" id="pg_89"></a>

    <h4>IMAGINATION</h4>

    <p>Oncet, when I was a gret big man, I got mad at the way<br>
    Ol' nurses bossed the childruns an' so I wouldn't stay;<br>
    I jest got up and <span class="c15">pushed my house</span> right over&mdash;yes, I did;<br>
    An' then I turned the streets all round, and runned away and hid!<br>
    When I come back, my childruns was cryin' awful loud,<br>
    Fer nobody knowed <em>wher</em> they lived, an' there was <em>such</em> a crowd.<br>
    I says, "Now, folks must shet their eyes&mdash;don't open them a crack!"&mdash;<br>
    An' then I straightened out the streets, an' put the houses back.</p>

    <p>'N oncet I was a <span class="c15">neluphant</span>, as big as all outdoors,<br>
    'N every time I turned around it shook the roofs and floors;<br>
    I walked down to the river, and I drunk it up&mdash;<span class="c15">All</span> up,<br>
    Jest like it was some cambric tea in my ol' silver cup.<br>
    An' when the people come fer me, I jest set down, kerplunk!<br>
    An' squashed 'em flat&mdash;an' picked them up&mdash;an' packed 'em in my trunk!<br>
    'N then <span class="c15">I twist my trunk off</span>, an' throwed it all away&mdash;<br>
    You better let me go, Louise&mdash;<span class="c15">I might</span> do that to-day!</p>

    <p>You won't? All right&mdash;you'd <span class="c15">better did</span>, for one time long ago,<br>
    Before I gotter be a boy, I was a <span class="c15">bear</span>&mdash;oh, no&mdash;<br>
    I was a <span class="c15">snake</span>&mdash;a yaller snake, an' I was ten <span class="c15">miles long</span>,<br>
    'N all I et was nurse girls&mdash;yes, I did, although 'twas wrong.<br>
    That was a million years ago, but something&mdash;inside me&mdash;<br>
    Tells me I'm goin' to be a snake <span class="c15">again</span>&mdash;jest watch and see!<br>
    You don't believe a word I say? Well, I don't care&mdash;<span class="c15">I do</span>&mdash;<br>
    How could <span class="c15">I 'member</span> all these things, unlessen they was true?</p><a name="pg_91" id="pg_91"></a>

    <h4>WILLING TO TRADE</h4>

    <p>The doctor brung a baby up to our house last week&mdash;<br>
    A little bit of thing it is&mdash;but my! it's gotta squeak!<br>
    It makes a noise that's twice as big as you expect to hear,<br>
    And then ma says, "Go right away&mdash;you mustn't tease him, dear!"<br>
    <span class="c2">She seems to like it more than me&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">But I ain't jealous, no, siree!</span></p>

    <p>I told the boys, and Billy Black, he says, "Well, that is nice,<br>
    But I would rather have my dog&mdash;they're worth more at the price,<br>
    For pa says babies cost a lot to feed and dress and train,<br>
    And Rover, he is smart, he is, and gotter splendid brain!"<br>
    <span class="c3">I kinder feel that very way&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c3">But ma says baby's come to stay.</span></p>

    <p>Frank Brown has got a billygoat that pulls him on his sled,<br>
    And Kenneth's got a ponycart; but pa looked cross and said<br>
    I mustn't talk so foolish when I asked him if I might<br>
    Go trade our baby for a pony or a goat, last night.<br>
    <span class="c2">I s'pose he knew <em>nobody'd</em> trade</span><br>
    <span class="c2">A goat for any baby made!</span><br>
    I wouldn't mind it, I believe, if any boy I knew<br>
    Would <em>envy</em> me for what we've got, but that's what they won't do!</p><a name="pg_93" id="pg_93"></a>

    <h4>THE LONELY CHILD</h4>

    <p>It takes so long to grow up big and get to be a man,<br>
    I wisht sometimes that I'd been born as old as Mary Ann;<br>
    (She is the cook, and she's so old her teeth come out at night),<br>
    'Cause then I wouldn't want a boy to play with or to fight.<br>
    <span class="c2">But now I go upstairs and down</span><br>
    <span class="c3">And get in people's way,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Because there ain't <em>no</em> children here</span><br>
    <span class="c3">To play with every day.</span></p>

    <p>The house next door is big and fine, but nobody lives there;<br>
    And all the winders, like big eyes, just stare at me, and stare,<br>
    Until I run back in our house and 'tend like I can't see,<br>
    And feel my way around the rooms till ma, she says to me:<br>
    <span class="c2">"My goodness, Rob, what is this game?</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Pretending you are blind?</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Dear me! The child has surely got</span><br>
    <span class="c3">A most peculiar mind."</span></p>

    <p>I've ast my pa to go and buy a brother for me, too;<br>
    But he jest shakes his head and says that it would never do;<br>
    And then he takes a book up quick and reads to me and tries<br>
    To make me laugh and talk to him; but sometimes ma, she cries.<br>
    <span class="c2">But even then I seem to see</span><br>
    <span class="c3">The empty house next door</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And all those big, dark window-eyes</span><br>
    <span class="c3">That stared at me before.</span></p>

    <p>Some time I'm going to run away and find a father-man<br>
    Who has whole lots of boys and girls&mdash;for I am sure I can&mdash;<br>
    And when I do, I'm going to ast him please to come and take<br>
    The house next door and live in it&mdash;and&mdash;do it for my sake!<br>
    <span class="c2">And if he does, oh, won't it be</span><br>
    <span class="c3">A happy day for me?</span><br>
    <span class="c2">I'll get a lot of brothers, then,</span><br>
    <span class="c3">Without <em>no</em> bother&mdash;see?</span></p><a name="pg_95" id="pg_95"></a>

    <h4>THE LITTLE FELLER'S GONE</h4>

    <p>Th' little feller's gone! Since he was so big, him an' I<br>
    Have been like good old cronies, agreein' on the sly<br>
    <span class="c9">To skip the years between.</span><br>
    He was jest goin' on five years&mdash;an' I am "Grandpa Brown,"<br>
    Although he named me "Santa Claus" when fust he come to town&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c9">An' my white beard he seen.</span><br>
    But now it seems to me a'most<br>
    <span class="c2">As soon as he was born,</span><br>
    <span class="c9">Th' little feller's gone.</span></p>

    <p>He won't be standin' by the gate to holler to me, "Hi!<br>
    Wait fer me, Santy!" like he done when I went stumpin' by<br>
    <span class="c9">T' fetch the cows back home.</span><br>
    We'll never sit agin an' argue which way we should go;<br>
    Or figger if that bird was jest a blackwing er a crow,<br>
    <span class="c9">Nor through the meadows roam.</span><br>
    Fer he has found a place up there<br>
    <span class="c3">Where it is always dawn&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c9">Th' little feller's gone.</span></p>

    <p>He was so full of fun I uster feel my heavy years<br>
    Drop from me when I went with him. Sometimes he'd pull my ears<br>
    <span class="c9">And say, "Hear dat Bob White?</span><br>
    Dat is a quail a-whistlin' in de woods, somewhere&mdash;le's go<br>
    An' ketch him&mdash;we can sprinkle salt upon his tail, you know!"<br>
    <span class="c9">And then he'd laugh outright;</span><br>
    But now, I don't take int'rust in<br>
    <span class="c2">A thing that's goin' on&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c9">Th' little feller's gone.</span></p>

    <p>It must be right, but somehow I can't look at it that way&mdash;<br>
    Why should he go, so young and good, and me&mdash;so worn out&mdash;stay?<br>
    But mebbe up in heaven he will think of me and wait<br>
    And holler "Hi!" when he sees me a-limpin' to the Gate,<br>
    And mebbe (where is my old han'kerchief a-got to now?)<br>
    He'll say to Peter, "Let him in&mdash;<em>I</em> like him, anyhow!"</p><a name="pg_97" id="pg_97"></a>

    <h4>THE FISHERMAN'S SON</h4>

    <p>When pa comes back home from his trip,<br>
    <span class="c2">All brown and freckle-faced,</span><br>
    He's fatter than he's been for months&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">There ain't no cloth to waste</span><br>
    When he puts on his old fall suit<br>
    <span class="c2">And sits out on the lawn,</span><br>
    And tells about the fish he caught&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">But my! how ma does yawn!</span></p>

    <p>Pa smokes a puff or two, and then<br>
    <span class="c2">He says, "You ought to see</span><br>
    The one I caught on Thursday&mdash;long<br>
    <span class="c2">As 'tis from you to me.</span><br>
    I had him on the bank; yes, sir,<br>
    <span class="c2">As sure as you are born,</span><br>
    And then he jumped right back again&mdash;"<br>
    <span class="c2">But ma&mdash;how she does yawn!</span></p>

    <p>I got a hook and line that ain't<br>
    <span class="c2">Like pa's, but still it's fun</span><br>
    To go down to the creek and fish<br>
    <span class="c2">And keep out of the sun.</span><br>
    Ma gives me sandwiches to eat,<br>
    <span class="c2">And when the last bite's gone</span><br>
    I guess I go to sleep, sometimes&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">At least I know I yawn.</span></p>

    <p>But one day I <em>did</em> ketch a fish;<br>
    <span class="c2">Ma took it, and it weighed</span><br>
    A pound, she said; but pa looked cross<br>
    <span class="c2">And said, "It must have strayed."</span><br>
    We had it cooked for supper, too,<br>
    <span class="c2">And ma and I ate some;</span><br>
    But pa, he wouldn't, and ma laughed;<br>
    <span class="c2">But all she <em>said</em> was "hu-u-m!"</span></p><a name="pg_99" id="pg_99"></a>

    <h4>THE DOG CONFESSES</h4>

    <p>I am a lucky dog, I know, and all my friends agree<br>
    The people that I live with now are good as gold to me<br>
    Because three times I saved a life&mdash;and that is why they give<br>
    Me everything a dog could want&mdash;and will, while I shall live.<br>
    <span class="c2">But I've a conscience, and I must</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Confess the truth&mdash;or else I'll bust!</span></p>

    <p>One day the cart that Bobbie drives ran up on pony's heels,<br>
    And off he bolted! I went, too, and mixed up with the wheels,<br>
    Until the cart came to a stop, and Bobbie-boy was saved&mdash;<br>
    Then folks wept o'er the noble way that I, a dog, behaved.<br>
    <span class="c2">(The truth is, I got in that mix</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Avoiding pony's vicious kicks!)</span></p>

    <p>Another time, when Bobbie went to play out on the dock<br>
    He fell into the water there, (he'd stumbled on a block);<br>
    I sprang in after him, of course, and dragged him back to land&mdash;<br>
    Then everybody said the way I acted was "just grand."<br>
    <span class="c2">(The rat that I was chasing when</span><br>
    <span class="c2">I plunged, I never saw again!)</span></p>

    <p>You see this stubby tail of mine? I got that when a car<br>
    Came near to crushing Bobbie-boy&mdash;it gave us all a jar;<br>
    I knocked him off the track in time, but one wheel caught my tail<br>
    And cut it short; it hurt, of course, and I let out a wail&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">(The cur that I had hoped to fight</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Across the street, was out of sight!)</span></p>

    <p>So, though I haven't meant to be a noble brute at all,<br>
    <span class="c2">I have to take the praise they give, and hear them patiently;</span><br>
    But there is comfort in this thought&mdash;although it may seem small&mdash;<br>
    <span class="c2">There are some human heroes who are "posing"&mdash;just like me!</span></p><a name="pg_101" id="pg_101"></a>

    <h4>BR'ER RABBIT IN DE BRESH PILE</h4>

    <p>Br'er Rabbit sorter snoozin' in de Big Bresh Pile,<br>

    <h4>WHEN</h4>

    <p>When to the tired heart and soul and brain<br>
    <span class="c2">There comes, at last, the Unrepeated Call,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Where Silence and Eternal Rest are all</span><br>
    Ahead of me, without one touch of pain&mdash;</p>

    <p>Pause at the edge of this desired Dawn,<br>
    Turn down a glass, and then&mdash;Be glad I'm gone!</p>

    <p>For what the Future holds who knows, or cares?<br>
    <span class="c2">The Past is done, the Now is here alway&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">So, lighten it for those who needs must stay,</span><br>
    Breathe no regrets for him who onward fares.</p>

    <p>Back to the Night, face to the coming Dawn,<br>
    Bid him God-speed, and then&mdash;Be glad he's gone!</p>
